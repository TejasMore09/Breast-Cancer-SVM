# Breast-Cancer-SVM
This repository presents a complete workflow for solving a binary classification problem using Support Vector Machines (SVM) on the Breast Cancer dataset. The primary objective is to classify diagnose as either M or B. The process begins with loading and preparing the dataset by dropping irrelevant columns like id and the completely null Unnamed: 32 column. The target column diagnosis is label-encoded, mapping 'M' to 1 and 'B' to 0. For visualization purposes, only two features â€” radius_mean and texture_mean are selected to allow plotting in a 2D space.
The SVM classifier is trained using both a linear kernel and a radial basis function (RBF) kernel. After training, decision boundaries are visualized using matplotlib to demonstrate how each model separates the two classes in feature space. This visualization helps in understanding the difference between linear and non-linear classification boundaries.
To improve performance, hyperparameter tuning is performed using GridSearchCV, optimizing the regularization parameter C and the kernel coefficient gamma (for RBF). Finally, cross-validation is used to evaluate the generalization performance of the best model. All code, datasets and plots are included in this repository.
